# Variables, Zero Values, Blank Identifier

## Declaration, Assignment, and Initialization

### Variable for Zero Value
### Short Declaration Operator
### Multiple Initializations
### Variable When Specificity is Required

## Value and Type

- Go is statically typed, not dynamic.
- A variable holds a value of a specific type.
- You can't have unused variables in your code, which means the code is polluted and the compiler won't allow it.

## Zero Values

- `false` for boolean
- `0` for integer
- `0.0` for float
- `""` for string
- `nil` for:
  - pointers
  - functions
  - interfaces
  - slices
  - channels
  - maps

There is no variable hoisting in Go.

# Modular Programming / Structured Programming 
It is a Methodological and organized approach to writing software code. It involveds breaking downa lanrge software project into smaller , managable tasks and desigining and implementing each task in a logical and coherent manner. 

The goal of structured approach is to make the code more readable , maintainable and scalable , which helps to reduce errors , and improve software qulity. 

## Modulear Code : 
is essentail aspect of a structured approach to software development . 

It Refers to a programming techinque whre a large program is divided into smaller , independent modules or componens. Each modules perfoms a specific task and these modules are designed to work together to achive the overall functionality of the program. 



## Hands on Exercise 
- Create a github repo for your code 
- Push the code 
- add a version tag to your code of v1.0.0:
    - git tag 
    - git tag v1.0.0
    - git push origin -tags 
- add temp.txt file to your code 
- add a version tag to your code of v1.1.0
- look at your versions in github
